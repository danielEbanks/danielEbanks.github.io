I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate at Caltech in Social Sciences. My research interests include Political Methodology, American Politics, and Congress. I study how to innovate on statistical methods, machine learning  and natural language processing to understand American politics. In particular, I have worked on applications to political parties and representation in the U.S. Congress, congressional elections, trust in scientists, the interaction of fossil fuel companies and climate-focused IGOs/NGOs, and collective action movements such as MeToo. I also work on developing tensor-based methods for latent variable models, in addition to understanding applications for latent variable models to studying U.S. legislatures at the federal and state level. <br>

Outside of research, I'm an avid runner, traveler, and always looking for oppurtunities to brush up on my French!
