[If a Statistical Model Predicts That Common Events Should Occur Only Once in 10,000 Elections, Maybe itâ€™s the Wrong Model](https://gking.harvard.edu/10k). 
Joint with Jonathan N. Katz and Gary King
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> Political scientists forecast elections, not primarily to satisfy public interest, but to validate statistical models used for estimating many quantities of scholarly interest. Although we have learned a great deal from these models, they can be embarrassingly overconfident: Events that should occur once in 10,000 elections occur almost every year, and even those which should occur once in a trillion-trillion elections are sometimes observed. We develop a novel generative statistical model of US district-level congressional elections, validate it with extensive out-of-sample tests, and use it to compute the first correctly calibrated probabilities of incumbent losses, one of the most important quantities for evaluating a democracy.  We find that even when marginals vanish, incumbency advantage grows, and other dramatic changes occur, the risk of an out-party incumbent losing a midterm election contest has been high and essentially constant since the 1950s. We then develop a broader theory of American democracy consistent with the results from our generative model and discuss the broader implications of our generative modeling strategy.

## Prior Work

The Network of Large-Value Loans in the U.S. Joint with Anton Badev 
                     
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> We analyse the universe of large-value loans intermediated through Fedwire---the primary U.S. real-time, 
gross settlement service provided by the Federal Reserve System---for the period from 2007 to 2015. 
We embed banks' bilateral lending relationships and interest rate quotes in a game on a graph following Badev (2013), 
for which we approximate the equilibrium play via a <i>k</i>-player dynamic. We document a series of fundamental changes in the topology of bilateral loan network,
and propose a framework to study the evolution of concentration of large-value loan intermediaries.
