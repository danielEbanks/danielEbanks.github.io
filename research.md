## Prior Work

The Network of Large-Value Loans in the U.S. Joint with Anton Badev 
                     
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> We analyse the universe of large-value loans intermediated through Fedwire---the primary U.S. real-time, 
gross settlement service provided by the Federal Reserve System---for the period from 2007 to 2015. 
We embed banks' bilateral lending relationships and interest rate quotes in a game on a graph following Badev (2013), 
for which we approximate the equilibrium play via a <i>k</i>-player dynamic. We document a series of fundamental changes in the topology of bilateral loan network,
and propose a framework to study the evolution of concentration of large-value loan intermediaries.}
