I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate at Caltech. My research interests include Political Methodology, American Politics, and Congress. <br/><br/>Specifically, 
I study how to use networks and Natural Language Processing to understand the behavior of Political Parties in the U.S. Congress. I also work on developing tensor-based
methods for latent variable models, in addition to uncovering applications for latent variable models to studying U.S. Congressional elections at the federal and state level.
