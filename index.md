I am currently a third-year PhD student at Caltech. My research interest include Political Methodology, American Politics, and Congress. <br/><br/>Specifically, 
I study how to use networks and Natural Language Proccessing to understand the behavior of Political Parties in the U.S. Congress. I also work on developing tensor-based
methods for latent variable models, in addition to uncovering applications for latent variable models to studyinf U.S. Congressional results at the federal and state level.
