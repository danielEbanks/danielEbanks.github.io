Hi, my name is Danny! I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the Social Sciences at Caltech, with a research passion for political methodology and American politics. I strive to develop and implement statistical methods, to understand the latest in machine learning and AI, and innovate in these areas in ways small  and large to better understand our political world.  I am always eager to chat about research and statistics, so feel free to reach out. Outside of research, I'm lifelong runner who hails from New York.
